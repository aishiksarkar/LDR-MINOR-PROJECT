In this project we state show how the LDR sensor can detect light(red,green,blue) effectively.The LDR takes in analog value 
the one of RGB leds constanty flicker.This is used to intensify any green,red or blue light so that LDR can effectively take in
correct values of analog correctly and effectively.The values are compared and the highest one is made with digitalWrite HIGH and 
another led is made to glow.This led mainly serves as an output purpose.
